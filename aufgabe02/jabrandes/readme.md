 - Trailing spaces leave a mess in code. You really want to make sure to remove
	them. Most editors can do that automatically for you or at least highlight
	them.
 - Using a hard-coded token is not a good idea.
 - Not all pull requests are listed. Only one, but that one twice in the
	example [-1].
 - Instead of commit messages or pull request title, the pull request
	description is listed.
 - Recommondation: Have a look at things like [json-simple
	](https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple) for handling JSON.
